# Pentest & Bug Bounty Templates

This repo contains folder structure and template markdown files for keeping notes during pentests or bug bounty activities.

It is intended to be used with Obsidian.

## Getting started

After downloading the repo to a folder, do the following steps.


1. Create a new directory for your target (eg Tesla). Ideally this should be a subdirectory of your Obsidian vault directory.


```bash
mkdir $OBSIDIAN_VAULT_DIR/Tesla
```

2. Copy template structure recursively into new directory


```bash
cp -r $REPO_DOWNLOAD_FOLDER/templates/* $OBSIDIAN_VAULT_DIR/Tesla/
```

3. Open Obsidian to see new folder structure and template notes ready to be populated!
